Game of Being invents its own genre: playable philosophy. Don’t just read philosophy—play it.

World I is a practice of awareness—a meditation written as a video game.

Level 1 (“Who Am I?”) opens where the game actually runs: inside your attention. You don’t swing a sword; you breathe. You don’t grind for loot; you notice. And the world responds. With gentle mechanics—Save, Look, Move, Interact, Jump—you learn how perception renders reality and how a single honest breath can change the room you’re in.

• Every time you notice breath instead of fear, you’ve saved.
• Every time you pause before reacting, you’ve leveled up.
• Every time you see mind acting instead of being lost inside it, you’ve unlocked another door.

What you’ll explore:
– The Six Rings engine: Sense · Pattern · Story · Identity · Choice · Silence
– “Half-Inch of Freedom”: one breath that turns reaction into choice
– Transparency Protocol: wearing roles as tools, not prisons
– Mirror Key & Quiet Name: seeing without performance, identity without judgment
– Practical loops for ordinary life: inboxes, doorways, mirrors, hard conversations

This isn’t theory to memorize—it’s moments you can feel. The book treats paragraphs like rooms and breath like a controller, so awareness becomes playable in real time.

Press Start with one honest breath. Let the world load where you look.
