# Game of Being — World I · Level 1 — Who Am I?

**Playable philosophy.** Don’t just read philosophy—play it.

This repo hosts a lightweight React + Vite app that presents *World I — Level 1* as an interactive, developer‑ready scaffold. 
Use it to build the full game, export printables, or host a demo site.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev         # start locally
npm run build       # production build (dist/)
```
Deploy via GitHub Pages (included workflow) or any static host (Netlify, Vercel, S3).

It’s a meditation written as a video game.

Every time you notice your breath instead of your fear, you’ve “saved.”

Every time you pause before reacting, you’ve “leveled up.”

Every time you see your own mind acting instead of being lost inside it, you’ve unlocked another door.

## Core Mechanics

- **Look = Attention** — where you look, the world renders  
- **Move = Curiosity** — small lean toward, not interrogation  
- **Interact = Honesty** — one small true sentence opens doors  
- **Jump = Silence** — pause to cross distances argument can’t  
- **Save = Breath** — ⦿ Inhale 1 • Exhale 2

**Scoring:** No leaderboards. Self‑score each drill **0 / +1 / +2** by sincerity.
